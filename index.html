          <h4>Software Engineering intern</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Worked on the internal distributed Key Management System at Google,
              which holds encryption keys for almost all Google products and
              receives millions of queries per second. I worked on reducing the
              external attack surface area, the specifics of the project are under
              a Non-Disclosure Agreement.
            </li>
            <li>
              Implemented features on the C++ server side which greatly improved
              efficiency of key re-encryption.
            </li>
            <li>
              Created a Python library for parsing of thousands of configuration
              files and modification of said files in-place, maintaining order of
              human-redacted content.
            </li>
            <li>
              Designed and implemented a dashboard to track the progress of my
              project over time, such as the current status of keys in the server.
              The data was exported by a Python library I implemented and
              displayed using Google’s internal technology.

          <h4>Software Engineering intern</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Worked within the Xbox Studios Quality division to implement a
              module inside a large existing C# codebase to allow Test Leads to
              schedule bug bashes, to automate the process of setting up the
              device(s) of a tester participating in the bug bash, and to restore
              that device to its original state after finishing the bug bash.
            </li>
            <li>
              Gathered user requirements, defined the use cases, designed user
              interface mockups and had design document approved by my team to
              start implementation of the project.
            </li>
            <li>
              Implemented the backend and user interface for the part of the
              module that allows Test Leads to schedule bug bashes for their
              titles, include pertaining information and files to set up the
              devices.
            </li>
            <li>
              Implemented the backend and user interface for the part of the
              module that allows testers to enroll in a bug bash, which
              automatically sets up their devices, saving several minutes for each
              device the tester has.

          <ul>
            <li>
              Migrated an existing command line debugging tool for a Search Ads
              backend team into a web server tool, allowing engineers to save
              minutes for each lookup done, making the process of doing a lookup
              simpler.
            </li>
            <li>
              Refactored the existing C++ codebase, allowing unit tests to be done
              correctly using mocking techniques.
            </li>
            <li>
              Developed Protocol Buffers to allow data transfer between the C++
              backend and AngularJS frontend.
            </li>
            <li>
              Implemented server handlers to send Protocol Buffers through HTTP
              requests to the frontend.

            <li>
              Developed an open source RESTful JSON API in Ruby on Rails which
              interacts with the GitHub API and extracts information to display it
              in a clear and concise way to be used in a tvOS app developed by the
              mobile team and a web dashboard used to display the data, which was
              developed by me.
            </li>
            <li>
              Utilized Docker to maintain a consistent development environment to
              collaborate with my team.
            </li>
