        <ul>
          <li>
            Worked on the internal distributed Key Management System at Google,
            which holds encryption keys for almost all Google products and
            receives millions of queries per second. I worked on reducing the
            external attack surface area, the specifics of the project are under
            a Non-Disclosure Agreement.
          </li>
          <li>
            Implemented features on the C++ server side which greatly improved
            efficiency of key re-encryption.
          </li>
          <li>
            Created a Python library for parsing of thousands of configuration
            files and modification of said files in-place, maintaining order of
            human-redacted content.
          </li>
          <li>
            Designed and implemented a dashboard to track the progress of my
            project over time, such as the current status of keys in the server.
            The data was exported by a Python library I implemented and
            displayed using Google’s internal technology.

        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Worked within the Xbox Studios Quality division to implement a
            module inside a large existing C# codebase to allow Test Leads to
            schedule bug bashes, to automate the process of setting up the
            device(s) of a tester participating in the bug bash, and to restore
            that device to its original state after finishing the bug bash.
          </li>
          <li>
            Gathered user requirements, defined the use cases, designed user
            interface mockups and had design document approved by my team to
            start implementation of the project.
          </li>
          <li>
            Implemented the backend and user interface for the part of the
            module that allows Test Leads to schedule bug bashes for their
            titles, include pertaining information and files to set up the
            devices.
          </li>
          <li>
            Implemented the backend and user interface for the part of the
            module that allows testers to enroll in a bug bash, which
            automatically sets up their devices, saving several minutes for each
            device the tester has.

        <ul>
          <li>
            Migrated an existing command line debugging tool for a Search Ads
            backend team into a web server tool, allowing engineers to save
            minutes for each lookup done, making the process of doing a lookup
            simpler.
          </li>
          <li>
            Refactored the existing C++ codebase, allowing unit tests to be done
            correctly using mocking techniques.
          </li>
          <li>
            Developed Protocol Buffers to allow data transfer between the C++
            backend and AngularJS frontend.
          </li>
          <li>
            Implemented server handlers to send Protocol Buffers through HTTP
            requests to the frontend.

        <ul>
          <li>
            Developed an open source RESTful JSON API in Ruby on Rails which
            interacts with the GitHub API and extracts information to display it
            in a clear and concise way to be used in a tvOS app developed by the
            mobile team and a web dashboard used to display the data, which was
            developed by me.
          </li>
          <li>
            Used Git best practices in conjunction with my team to ensure the
            quality control of the API.

          <li>
            Utilized Docker to maintain a consistent development environment to
            collaborate with my team.
